# Rimworld Mods

These is all my preferred 1.1 mods. It'll probably evolve over time, but for now it's simple enough to just keep in a readme. If you've any must-haves to recommend, feel free to send a PR or open an issue!

## Modlist

**Numbers** - Adds a customizable general overview tab, allowing you to see any stats across ALL your colonists or prisoners in a single window.
  Dependency: Harmony

**Avoid Friendly Fire** - Adds an option to avoid shooting your team in the back. If attacking enemy, will not shoot. If hunting, will reposition.
  Dependency: HugsLib

## Additional Dependencies

**Harmony** - This basically was a part of the original game, but was removed as of 1.1, so you need it now for many mods that were made for 1.0.

**HugsLib** - This is needed for many mods, as it provides useful tools for developers or something.


### 1.0 note:

If you decide to do 1.0 for some reason, there's a really nice and complete list of mods to use called [Hardcore-SK](https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK). I recommend checking that out, and removing the zombieland mod.
