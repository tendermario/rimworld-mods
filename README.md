# Rimworld Mods

These are all my preferred 1.1 mods. It'll probably evolve over time, but for now it's simple enough to just keep in a readme. If you've any must-haves to recommend, feel free to send a PR or open an issue!

## Modlist

**Numbers** - Adds a customizable general overview tab, allowing you to see any stats across ALL your colonists or prisoners in a single window.
- Dependency: **Harmony**

**Avoid Friendly Fire** - Adds an option to avoid shooting your team in the back. If attacking enemy, will not shoot. If hunting, will reposition.
- Dependency: **HugsLib**

**P-Music** - Adds 25 new songs to RimWorld.

**Range Finder** - Want to check the range you and enemies can shoot from? Just select one or more colonists or turrets and press the hotkey (CTRL by default). When you quickly press the key twice the range will stay visible until you press the key later again.

**Item List Selector** - Allows you to select stockpile items from the top left list of items.

**Awesome Inventory** - Loadout management, display relevant armor stats in one place, multiple equipping options. And more!

## Additional Dependencies

**Harmony** - This basically was a part of the original game, but was removed as of 1.1, so you need it now for many mods that were made for 1.0.

**HugsLib** - This is needed for many mods, as it provides useful tools for developers or something.


## Additional Resources:

I'm currently scouring this list to find out what other things to add here. It gives a great overview of some of the best mods, so check it out too if you're reading this: https://www.strategygamer.com/articles/best-rimworld-mods/

### 1.0 note:

If you decide to do 1.0 for some reason, there's a really nice and complete list of mods to use called [Hardcore-SK](https://github.com/skyarkhangel/Hardcore-SK). I recommend checking that out, and removing the zombieland mod.
